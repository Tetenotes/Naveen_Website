        <p>Hello! I am Thallapelli Naveen Kumar, a dedicated and passionate backend developer currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Information Systems at Pace University in New York. With over two years of professional experience, I have honed my skills in developing robust and scalable backend systems, specializing in Python programming and leveraging modern frameworks.</p>
        
        <p>From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. This interest propelled me to explore various aspects of software development, but I found my true calling in backend development, where I can create the underlying systems that power applications and services.</p>
        
        <p>During my tenure as a backend developer at Wipro Private Limited, I was involved in designing and implementing large-scale applications. My experience there allowed me to deepen my understanding of software architecture, database management, and cloud computing. I took pride in developing APIs that streamlined processes and improved the user experience, ensuring that the applications I worked on were not only efficient but also reliable and secure.</p>
        
        <p>I am particularly skilled in using frameworks such as Django and Flask, which have allowed me to build powerful web applications with ease. My proficiency in SQL and NoSQL databases, including MySQL and MongoDB, enables me to design data models that are optimized for performance and scalability. Additionally, I have experience in deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, where I have learned to utilize services such as EC2, S3, and Lambda to enhance application functionality and reliability.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to connecting and exploring new opportunities in the tech world!</p>
